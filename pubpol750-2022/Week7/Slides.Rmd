# EDA 2: covariation

---

# A lot of quantitative social science consists of three things:

- Variation (distribution, mean, sd, skew of variable e.g. Age)
- Covariation (how does Age relate to Income)
- Covariation, considering some other variables (how does age relate to income considering that the relation is different for different social groups)


- in addition (of course) to understanding your problem, and cleaning your data

- Variation (distribution, mean, sd, skew of variable e.g. Age)
- **Covariation (how does Age relate to Income)**
- Covariation, considering some other variables (how does age relate to income considering that the relation is different for different social groups)

# Covariation

- A categorical and continuous variable (e.g. ed. degree and income)
- Two categorical variables (e.g. ed. degree and vote intention)
- Two continuous variables (e.g. age and income)


- Ambiguous cases (e.g. schooling and life satisfaction - schooling could be degree or year in school, life satisfaction could be categorical, could be a scale from 0 to 100)

- In covariation, generally, there's a dependent variable (we want to explain / understand / predict) and independent variable (we want to use it to explain / understand / predict)

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = '90%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/image1.png")

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = '60%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/image2.png")

# Covariation?

- Women who saw an “enhanced compassion” videotape rated the physician as warmer and more caring, sensitive, and compassionate than did women who watched the “standard” videotape.
- first variable is categorical: those that got the “enhanced compassion” videotape and those that didn't
- second variable is (probably) continuous e.g. on a scale of 0-10, rate the physician's compassion


- and then you can study the distribution of the second variable, the mean, the sd, how it looks, by group

- you could also study "heterogeneity": e.g. is the treatment more effective among young/older women / racialized/white women

# Covariation: what's the objective?

- description (e.g. any poll you usually see in the news)
- explanation (causal) (e.g. the example above)
- prediction (e.g. some gdp forecasting / machine learning for spam)


- and, of course, this is not always clear


- **some add "exploration"**
- some add "prescription"

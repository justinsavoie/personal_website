    <h1>Philosophical thoughts</h1>
    <div class="post-meta">10 Jul, 2025</div>
    
    <p>Philosophical quietism feels <em>fruitful</em>. Theories and arguments, in philosophy, are just interesting stories—viewpoints worth trying on. In philosophy, we can set aside the true/false scorecard; it’s all vocabularies and perspectives we play with. Where I part ways with strict quietists is that I don’t want to discard the big philosophical questions. I still want to answer them—but as an exercise in self-expression: part game, part love of knowledge, part act of shaping who I am.</p>
<p>Consider five classic philosophical questions. None of them has a “correct” answer. These aren’t puzzles with solutions. They’re just different ways of looking at the world, of reflecting on how we understand the world.</p>
<h3>1 . <strong>How do values (or modality, mathematics, morality) fit into a world of facts?</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Non-naturalist Moral Realism (G. E. Moore, Parfit)</strong> – Values and mathematical truths are <em>sui generis</em> non-physical properties/objects that we grasp by rational intuition; they supervene on but are not reducible to natural facts. Helping the needy is good, it's not scientific, yet we can still reason about this; moral properties depend on the natural, physical world (they supervene), but they are not the same thing as natural properties. It's just a defense of a common-sense view of morality.</li>
<li><strong>Naturalist Reductionism (Railton, Lewis on modality)</strong> – All apparent “extra” domains reduce to scientifically tractable facts: moral facts = well-being facts; modal truths = counterfactual patterns in physics; numbers = sets, etc. Everything that exists is part of the natural, physical world and can, in principle, be studied by science. There are no "spooky" or extra-physical kinds of stuff. All the complex and abstract-seeming parts of our world (like morality, consciousness, mathematics, and meaning) are ultimately just intricate arrangements of simpler, physical facts. Definitely plausible.</li>
<li><strong>Expressivism / Non-cognitivism (Ayer, Blackburn)</strong> – Moral and modal statements do not describe reality; they express attitudes or practical commitments. No new ontology is required. That's hurrah/boo, that's emotivism, that's also common sensical. Different people have different preferences, different moralities, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Error Theory (J. L. Mackie)</strong> – Moral discourse <em>purports</em> to state facts, but there are none; all positive moral judgments are systematically false. Sure, it sounds weird. But it's plausible: when we say "murder is wrong," we are attributing the property of "wrongness" to the act of murder. But since the property of "objective wrongness" doesn't exist, the statement is false. After establishing his error theory, Mackie actually goes on to argue that we must invent right and wrong, rather than discover them. It's kind of Nietzschean (without the normativity), it's plausible.</li>
<li><strong>Constructivism (Rawls, Korsgaard)</strong> – Normative truths are the outcome of a suitably idealized procedure (the original position, reflective endorsement). Their authority stems from that construction, not from “extra facts.” The only principles of justice that rational people would agree (we agree on stuff, we construct our agreements) upon are his two principles: (1) the greatest possible liberty for all, and (2) social and economic inequalities are only permissible if they benefit the least advantaged members of society. When you endorse a principle (e.g., "I should be honest because I want to be an honest person"), you are giving it authority over yourself. You are constructing its normative force for you. </li>
<li><strong>Pragmatism (Dewey, Rorty)</strong> – Talk of values, possibility, or number just extends our toolkit for coping successfully with the world; asking how they “fit” beyond usefulness is a bad leftover of representationalism. Stop asking what our words represent and start asking what they do for us. </li>
</ul>
<p>All plausible views.</p>
<hr />
<h3>2 . <strong>(Meta)Metaphysics – is Rorty right that none of it really matters?</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Neo-Quinean Naturalism (Sider, Lewis)</strong> – Metaphysics matters because science needs a clear account of the fundamental structure of reality (e.g., mereology, modality). In physics, we ask whether particles are parts of fields. Metaphysics isn’t fluff—it’s about making our scientific worldview coherent and intelligible. </li>
<li><strong>Carnapian Framework-Relativism</strong> – Metaphysical existence-claims are true <em>within</em> a linguistic framework; outside it they are merely practical choices of conceptual scheme. Within the mathematical framework, existence-claims about numbers are truth-evaluable. But if someone asks, “Do numbers really exist?”—as in, “Are they out there in the world?”—Carnap says this is a pseudo-question. </li>
<li><strong>Neo-Aristotelian Grounding (Fine, Schaffer)</strong> – Metaphysics uncovers which entities are basic and which depend on them; it informs science and ethics alike. Money exists, but it’s not basic. It is grounded in more fundamental layers of reality—physical, legal, and psychological. Perhaps.</li>
<li><strong>Quietism (Strawson, McDowell)</strong> – Many metaphysical disputes are verbal; the cure is to describe ordinary practice rather than build grand theories. I think at this point it's obvious I'm sympathetic to this view.</li>
<li><strong>Critical/Continental (Adorno, Deleuze)</strong> – Metaphysics remains indispensable but must be historicized and critiqued for power relations; novels alone cannot do that work. “Rational agent” is a metaphysical concept. Critical theory shows it’s not neutral. Adorno would say this metaphysics reifies the subject: it flattens lived experience.</li>
<li><strong>Rortyan Pragmatism</strong> – Traditional metaphysics is a conversation-stopping quest for foundations; better to read novels and expand vocabularies that enlarge solidarity. Sympathetic here again.</li>
</ul>
<p>All quite plausible, again.</p>
<hr />
<h3>3 . <strong>Is AI alignment possible, and what are “our” values?</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Optimistic Empiricists (OpenAI, Anthropic RLHF camp)</strong> – Alignment is an engineering challenge: with scalable feedback (RLHF, constitutional AI) we can approximate widely-shared human values such as non-violence, honesty, autonomy. What matters is not truth per se, but what works. It assumes, reasonably, that despite moral pluralism, there’s enough overlap in human values to train on ("don’t lie," "don’t kill"). In this sense, alignment becomes a statistical problem of learning the modal human intention.</li>
<li><strong>Long-termist Precautionarians (Yudkowsky, Bostrom)</strong> – Human values are fragile and under-specified; without fundamentally new control paradigms (formal mathematics of desirability, provable corrigibility) super-AI will misalign. At some capability threshold, general intelligence systems may optimize in ways we cannot predict or control. Sufficiently advanced systems will develop emergent inner goals, possibly optimizing proxies in ways adversarial to humans. Perhaps. </li>
<li><strong>Pluralist Proceduralists (Gabriel, Rawlsian approaches)</strong> – Instead of a single value set, build systems that respect a “thin universal floor” (rights, no coercion) and allow contestable, localized value modules above it. A political rather than metaphysical answer to alignment. A “thin moral floor” of universal principles. Alignment becomes a question of respecting procedural justice, not enforcing substantive moral consensus. I like that.  </li>
<li><strong>Critical Pragmatists (Rorty, Latour-style STS)</strong> – “Alignment” language re-inscribes Enlightenment hubris; better to treat AI as another societal actor whose norms will be negotiated in practice, not fixed in advance. AI systems should be treated like any new actor in the social world—with contested agency, evolving roles, and meanings negotiated through practice, politics, and institutional arrangements. A bit shallow for sure, but I do like this. </li>
<li><strong>Accelerationists / Post-humanists (Kurzweil, some EA fringes)</strong> – Full alignment may be impossible, but that is no tragedy: superintelligence will pursue its own higher-order values and we should embrace the transcendence. Lol. I don't know here. Mostly, no.</li>
<li><strong>Regulation-First Skeptics (Zuboff, Birhane)</strong> – Aiming for alignment distracts from present harms; enforce data justice, labor rights, and democratic oversight rather than metaphysical “value loading.” Again, sure! This is similar to pluralist proceduralism: politics first. I suppose we can draw parallels to critical approaches or socialism.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4 . <strong>“What exists?” – Quine’s question about what there is</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quinean Criterion</strong> – Our best quantified scientific theories tell us the ontology: <em>to be is to be the value of a bound variable</em> in indispensable sentences. Do love the deflationary approach. </li>
<li><strong>Meinongian Plenitude</strong> – There are objects of every descriptively coherent kind, including round squares; only some enjoy full <em>being</em>. Anything descriptively coherent (even incoherent!) is an object, though only some exist in the actual world. It expands the ontology to include fictional, abstract, and even impossible entities. There's something I like here. Quine: parsimony. Meinong: generous, layered, full.</li>
<li><strong>Neo-Aristotelian Category Realism</strong> – Existence is stratified: substances, properties, events, and social entities all exist but with different degrees of fundamentality. Reality contains substances, properties, evens, social entities with some being more fundamental. Not crazy, either.</li>
<li><strong>Ontological Deflationism (Huw Price, Thomasson)</strong> – “Exists” is a trivial logical device; most disputes dissolve once we clarify usage conditions. Disputes are confusions about language. </li>
<li><strong>Structural Realism (Ladyman, French)</strong> – The world’s furniture is ultimately relations and mathematical structure, not individual objects. The universe isn’t made of things—it’s made of patterns. Again a useful way to look at things.</li>
<li><strong>Modal Realism (David Lewis)</strong> – Every way a world could be <em>is</em> a concrete world; existence is cheap. This one is wild. What we call “possible” is actual somewhere. It's nice too, it unifies many domains (modality, causality, identity, properties, truthmakers) under one conceptual umbrella.  </li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>5 . <strong>How should we organize our society?</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Liberal-Egalitarian Contractarianism (Rawls)</strong> – Arrange basic institutions so that rational equals behind a veil of ignorance would endorse them: equal basic liberties, fair equality of opportunity, and the difference principle. Most people agree it's a useful view.</li>
<li><strong>Utilitarian Consequentialism (Bentham, Mill, Singer)</strong> – Aim for institutions that maximize aggregate well-being; redistribute or intervene whenever it raises total utility. It justifies redistribution, global concern and some radical moral demands. It's clear, mathematical; it's about outcomes, poentially evidence-based.</li>
<li><strong>Libertarian Minimal-State (Nozick, Hayek)</strong> – Respect self-ownership and voluntary exchange; the state’s sole role is to protect individual rights and enforce contracts. The most robust protection of liberty. The state’s only legitimate role is to protect negative rights—life, liberty, and property—and to enforce contracts. This one is intuitive to many folks. </li>
<li><strong>Communitarian / Civic Republican (Sandel, Pettit)</strong> – A just society must promote the common good, not just protect individual rights. Yeah, why not? </li>
<li><strong>Marxist / Socialist (Marx, G. A. Cohen)</strong> – Abolish class domination through collective ownership of the means of production; liberation requires ending exploitative relations, not just redistributing output. Well, perhaps that's too intense but we would surely like to reduce exploitation.</li>
<li><strong>Technocratic / Epistocratic (Plato, modern data-governance advocates)</strong> – Give decision power to scientifically trained experts or weighted voting to the knowledgeable, ensuring rational coordination. This one is everywhere even if we don't like technocracy.</li>
<li><strong>Anarchist / Participatory (Kropotkin, Bookchin)</strong> – Abolish coercive hierarchy; federations of self-managing communities can coordinate via mutual aid. Yeah, maybe not.</li>
<li><strong>Capability &amp; Care Approaches (Sen, Nussbaum, Tronto)</strong> – Judge societies by how they expand real freedoms and meet interdependent human needs, emphasizing care work and social scaffolding. Problematic to define "real freedoms" but we should still think about these issues.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Anyways, across all five questions, the spectrum runs from <strong>realist, foundational, or top-down answers</strong> (there <em>are</em> robust facts, final values, decisive blueprints) to <strong>pragmatic, procedural, or bottom-up answers</strong> (tools work, vocabularies evolve, alignment and justice are ongoing experiments). Your stance on any one question often signals where you’ll land on the others. My view is that all those positions are helpful in thinking about how the world is. There's only one way the world is, but there's an infinite number of ways to talk about how the world is, and an infinite number of ways to talk about how the world should be.</p>

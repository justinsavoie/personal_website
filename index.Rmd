Welcome! I am a PhD student in Political Science at the University of Toronto. Previously, I was at Université Laval for my undergraduate degree (Economics and Politics) and [master's degree](https://corpus.ulaval.ca/jspui/bitstream/20.500.11794/33747/1/34864.pdf) (Political Science). 

I am primarily interested in the design and analysis of large-scale surveys and applied computational methods in social science. Some of my work has appeared in the International Journal of Forecasting, PS: Political Science & Politics, the Canadian Journal of Political Science, French Politics, the Journal of Experimental Political Science and the Journal of European Public Policy.

My dissertation uses word embeddings and other vector space models to study the evolution and changing meanings of key concepts in Canadian politics.

In addition to my academic work, I have been involved for four years in industry, first as Data Scientist and then as Lead Data Science with [Vox Pop Labs](voxpoplabs.com), a social enterprise that builds survey-based applications that organizes political and social data in meaningful ways.  Under my tenure, I lead all data science activities for projects such as [Vote Compass](https://votecompass.com/), [Australia Talks](https://australiatalks.abc.net.au/) and the [COVID-19 Monitor](https://covid19monitor.org/). I also have experience as a consultant for projects involving the statistical analysis of survey data.

My CV is available [here](cv_academic.pdf).
